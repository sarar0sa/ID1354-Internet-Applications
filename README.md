## Seminar 4: JavaScript
Goal:
* Learn JavaScript.
* Learn to use jQuery to facilitate event handling and updates to the DOM.
* Learn to use a framework, for example Knockout, to improve architecture and
design of the JavaScript client.

Use JavaScript and AJAX for, at least, reading and writing and deleting recipe comments. To navigate between index, recipe and calendar pages, and to login/logout, may still be done by loading entire HTML documents. Your are, however, allowed to use AJAX also for this, if you wish. You are not required to implement a viewmodel layer. Instead, you are allowed to store all data, like for example recipe comments, in HTML elements in the DOM tree. You are encouraged to use jQuery, since it is normally easier, but it is not a requirement.
